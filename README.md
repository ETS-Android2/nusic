## Build
### Modules
| Module             | Packaging      | Description   |
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------- |
| parent             | - | Global build properties for all modules |
| nusic-apk          | apk | Assembly maven module containing the guice module, wires up all dependencies and builds the APK |
| nusic-ui-android   | aar | Contains all android specific frontend-code |
| nusic-core-api     | jar | Interfaces of the central logic module |
| nusic-core-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the central logic module |
| nusic-data-api     | jar | Interfaces of the persistence module |
| nusic-data-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the persistence module |
| nusic-domain       | jar | Domain objects for persistence and migration between the layers |
| nusic-util         | jar | Utility module, containing logic common to all modules |

### Gradle
In order to build the APK use the [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) to download the SDK Version specified in the [parent project's build.gradle](build.gradle) and deploy android to your local maven repo using [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer). Also make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to `sdk` folder of your Android SDK.
Then just run  
```sh
gradlew clean check assembleDebug
```
to compile from scratch, run the tests and create a debug-signed APK, or run  

```sh
gradlew clean check assembleRelease
```
to create a signed APK, using an custom keystore.  

For passing the credentials for this keystore via the command line there are four options  

1. Define them in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` like so  

   ```ini
   signKeystore=FULL/path/to/keystore
   signAlias=the key's alias within the keystore
   signKeypass=password for keystore
   signStorepasss=password for key
   ```
2. Pass them as command line properties, e.g.  

   ```sh
   gradlew clean check assembleRelease -PsignAlias="the key's alias within the keystore"
   ```  
3. Pass them as environment variables, e.g.  

   ```sh
   export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signAlias=the key's alias within the keystore
   ```
4. or pass them as system property, e.g.

   ```sh
   gradlew clean check assembleRelease -Dorg.gradle.project.signKeystore=signAlias="the key's alias within the keystore"
   ```


## Creating a release
TODO Automate this, e.g. via Jenkins

- Start release  

   ```sh
   git-flow release start v.2.1.1
   ```
- Set Version  

   ```sh
   gradlew setVersion -PnewVersion=2.1.1
   ```
- Update [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
- Commit  

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare release v.2.1.1"
    ```
- Finish release & Tag (+ tag message)

   ```sh
   git-flow release finish v.2.1.1
   ```
- Set next dev version & commit

    ```sh
    gradlew setVersion -PnewVersion=2.1.2-SNAPSHOT
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for next development iteration v.2.1.2-SNAPSHOT"
    ```
- Checkout and build tag

    ```sh
    git checkout tags/v.2.1.1
    gradlew clean check assembleRelease
    ```
- Push all branches & tags

    ```sh
    git push --all
    git push --tags
    ```
