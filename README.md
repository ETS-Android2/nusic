| Module             | Packaging      | Description   |
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------- |
| parent             | - | Global build properties for all modules |
| nusic-apk          | apk | Assembly maven module containing the guice module, wires up all dependencies and builds the APK |

### Gradle
In order to build the APK use the [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) to download the SDK Version specified in the [parent project's build.gradle](build.gradle) and deploy android to your local maven repo using [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer). Also make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to `sdk` folder of your Android SDK.
Then just run
```sh
gradlew clean check assembleDebug
```
to compile from scratch, run the tests and create a debug-signed APK, or run

```sh
gradlew clean check assembleRelease
```
to create a signed APK, using an custom keystore.

For passing the credentials for this keystore via the command line there are four options

1. Define them in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` like so

   ```ini
   signKeystore=FULL/path/to/keystore
   signAlias=the key's alias within the keystore
   signKeypass=password for keystore
   signStorepasss=password for key
   ```
2. Pass them as command line properties, e.g.

   ```sh
   gradlew clean check assembleRelease -PsignAlias="the key's alias within the keystore"
   ```
3. Pass them as environment variables, e.g.

   ```sh
   export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signAlias=the key's alias within the keystore
   ```
4. or pass them as system property, e.g.

   ```sh
   gradlew clean connectedCheck assembleRelease -Dorg.gradle.project.signKeystore=signAlias="the key's alias within the keystore"
   ```
